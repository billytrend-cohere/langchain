Lead singer Nicholas Petricca started the band in 2006, while a student at Kenyon College, deriving the band's name from the song \"Walking on the Moon\" by The Police. Although the band is best known for their most successful hit single to date \"Shut Up and Dance\", other notable songs include \"Anna Sun\" and \"One Foot\".\n",

      "The group independently released their debut studio album, I Want! I Want!, in November 2010, receiving airplay for the track \"Anna Sun\" on multiple alternative radio stations. Along with the success of \"Anna Sun\", Alt Nation named them a band you need to know for the summer of 2012. Influential music blog Neon Gold helped to break the band in January 2011, calling \"Anna Sun\", \"the kind of stuff British A&R dreams, and major label bidding wars, are made of.\" In February 2011, Walk the Moon signed to RCA Records.\n",
      "In 2011, the band members began to paint their faces for live performances and they would bring enough paint to share with audience members.  They have claimed it has become a “live tradition”. Bonnaroo’s camera crew documented the painting process in a short video from the 2011 festival. The band played at the Sasquatch Music Festival and Firefly Music Festival. In these years, they were known for their energetic performances and tireless touring schedule.\n",
      "Before the release of their self-titled album, Walk the Moon joined many other performers at the Music Midtown festival and performed on the Great Southeast Music Hall Stage in Atlanta, Georgia in September 2011.  In spring 2011, the band went on a short tour with the west coast band, Grouplove, as well as supporting Panic! at the Disco and Weezer on select dates.  The band played on the main stage at the 20th Anniversary of Lollapalooza and also supported Local Natives in an Official Lollaplooza Aftershow at Lincoln Hall.\n",
      "The band recorded i Want! i Want! with Chris Schmidt and Ben Cochran at Soap Floats Recording Studio in their hometown of Cincinnati, Ohio and then self-released it.  The lead single from the album, \"Anna Sun\", became a surprise hit in the summer of 2011 following an endorsement by the Esquire article \"30 Summer Songs Every Man Should Listen To\". The song was written by Petricca and New York songwriter Nick Lerangis as their time at Kenyon College came to an end. \"It's about college, about maintaining that little bit of being a kid,\" Petricca said. \"Don't be afraid to play.\" The song was named after one of their favorite teachers. It was named song of the summer by MTV and Seventeen Mag, and one of the top songs of the year by Amazon.  It has been officially remixed by Fool's Gold and received a Trouble Productions remix by Albert Hammond Jr. Anna Sun rose to the number one spot on Alt. Nation on Sirius XM Radio. \"Anna Sun\" was added to the video rotation of American Eagle Outfitters stores in May 2011. It was featured on the hit TV show Vampire Diaries in the first episode of season three. It was also the free single of the week on iTunes for the week of May 15.\n",
      "Filmed in 2011 in Cincinnati's Over-the-Rhine neighborhood, the \"Anna Sun\" music video was released to coincide with the album. The video was shot on-location at the Cincinnati Mockbee building, as well as at a city park. It was directed and produced by Patrick Meier of the Cincinnati company, Contrast Productions, and features original choreography from Kim Popa of PONES Inc., as well as a cast full of the band's friends and locals from Cincinnati. MTV Hive calls the video a \"hilariously choreographed, neon-colored and awesomely shot in one take\" production.\n",

      "\"Man on the Moon\" is a song by American alternative rock band R.E.M., released in November 1992 as the second single from their eighth album, Automatic for the People (1992). The lyrics were written by lead singer Michael Stipe, and the music by drummer Bill Berry and guitarist Peter Buck. The song was well received by critics and reached number 30 on the US Billboard Hot 100, number 17 on the US Cash Box Top 100, number 18 on the UK Singles Chart, and number one in Iceland. It remains one of R.E.M.'s most popular songs and was included on the compilations In Time: The Best of R.E.M. 1988–2003 and Part Lies, Part Heart, Part Truth, Part Garbage 1982–2011.\n",
      "\"Man on the Moon\" is a tribute to comedian Andy Kaufman, with numerous references to his career including his Elvis impersonation, wrestling, and the film My Breakfast with Blassie. The song's title and chorus refer to Moon landing conspiracy theories, as an oblique allusion to rumors that Kaufman's death in 1984 was faked. The song gave its name to Miloš Forman's Kaufman biopic Man on the Moon (1999), and features prominently in the film's soundtrack.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Composition ==\n",
      "\"Man on the Moon\" is a mid-tempo country-rock song following a verse-chorus structure with an added pre-chorus and an instrumental bridge following the second and third choruses. The song has six lines in the first verse but only four in the second and third verses.An early instrumental demo of the song was known to the band as \"C to D Slide\". Guitarist Peter Buck has explained how the music came together: \"'Man on the Moon' was something that Bill [Berry] had, this one chord change that he came in with, which was C to D like the verse of the song, and he said: 'I don't know what to do with that.' I used to finish some of Bill's things ... he would come up with the riffs, but I would be the finish guy for that. I sat down and came up with the chorus, the bridges, and so forth. I remember we showed it to Mike and Michael when they came in later; definitely we had the song finished. I think Bill played bass and I played guitar; we kept going around with it. I think we might have played some mandolin on it in the rehearsal studio.\"Michael Stipe explained in an interview with Charlie Rose how the lyric was written independently of the music, which had no prior association with the song's eventual lyrical content regarding Kaufman. Stipe recounted the other R.E.M. members had written and performed the music of the song and recorded it along with the rest of the Automatic for the People album during studio sessions in Seattle. As of the final week of the recording sessions, Stipe was still struggling to write the lyric, and the others continued to plead with him to finish it. Stipe attempted to argue the track should be an instrumental, but his bandmates were insistent. Stipe listened to the track on a walk around Seattle on his Walkman cassette player and was inspired to write about Andy Kaufman. After Stipe went back to the studio to complete the vocal track, the track was mixed that night and sent out the following day to be mastered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Lyric ==\n",
      "The song's lyric does not tell a conventional story and instead forms a collection of cultural references, images and ideas. There are repeated mentions of Andy Kaufman, including references to his Elvis impersonation and work with wrestlers Fred Blassie and Jerry Lawler. The song also invokes the conspiracy theories surrounding the Moon landing and Elvis Presley's death as an indirect nod to the persistent rumors that Kaufman faked his own death. Speaking in 2017 to the NME, Mike Mills explained that the perceived ambiguity of Kaufman's legacy, including questions of whether he was a comedian or a performance artist, and whether his work was funny or irritating, was a way to frame other questions about life within the song:\n",
      "\n",
      "He's the perfect ghost to lead you through this tour of questioning things. Did the moon landing really happen? Is Elvis really dead? He was ki\n",
      "\n",
      "As part of the Apollo program by NASA, 24 astronauts flew nine missions to the Moon between December 1968 and December 1972. During six successful two-man landing missions, twelve men walked on the lunar surface, six of whom drove Lunar Roving Vehicles as part of the last three missions. Three men have been to the Moon twice, one orbited once and took a circumlunar trajectory the second time, while the other two landed once apiece. Apart from these 24 men, no human being has gone beyond low Earth orbit. No woman has been to the Moon, but a number of non-human animals have circled or orbited it, including two tortoises, several turtles, and five mice.\n",
      "Apollo missions 8 and 10–17 were the nine crewed missions to the Moon. Apollo 4–6 and AS-201 and AS-202 were uncrewed, while AS-203 is considered a test flight. The Apollo program included three other crewed missions: Apollo 1 (AS-204) did not launch and its crew died in a ground-based capsule fire, while Apollo 7 and Apollo 9 were low Earth orbit missions that only tested spacecraft components and docking maneuvers. Apollo missions 18, 19, and 20 were canceled. Twelve astronauts later flew unused Apollo command modules in the Apollo Applications Program's Skylab and Apollo–Soyuz Test Project. Of the 24 astronauts who flew to the Moon, two went on to command a Skylab mission, one commanded Apollo–Soyuz, one flew as commander for Approach and Landing Tests of the Space Shuttle, and two commanded orbital Space Shuttle missions.\n",

Slayton was responsible for making all Gemini and Apollo crew assignments. In March 1972, Slayton was restored to flight status, and flew on the 1975 Apollo–Soyuz Test Project mission.\n",
      "The prime crew members selected for actual missions are here grouped by their NASA astronaut selection groups, and within each group in the order selected for flight. Two versions of the Apollo Command/Service Module (CSM) spacecraft were developed: Block I, intended for preliminary low Earth orbit testing; and Block II, redesigned for the lunar landing. The Block I crew position titles were Command Pilot, Senior Pilot (second seat), and Pilot (third seat).  The corresponding Block II titles were: Commander, Command Module Pilot, and Lunar Module Pilot. The second seat pilot was given secondary responsibility for celestial navigation to keep the CSM's guidance computer accurately calibrated with the spacecraft's true position, and the third seat pilot served as a flight engineer, monitoring the health of the spacecraft systems.\n",

      "Garrison Arthur \"Gary\" Ewing (David Ackroyd in season 2, Ted Shackelford thereafter) was the middle son of Jock (Jim Davis) and Miss Ellie Ewing (Barbara Bel Geddes), husband of Valene (Joan Van Ark) and father of Lucy Ewing (Charlene Tilton). He appeared occasionally between season 2 and season 6, once in season 9, and the series finale in season 14. The character made 11 appearances on the show, Ackroyd for the first two and Shackelford for the remaining nine.\n",
      "Gary was the middle child, being born after J.R. (Larry Hagman) and before Bobby (Patrick Duffy). He was raised while Jock was at war, and displayed traits of his mother's family, the Southworths, which meant that Jock and J.R. saw him as a weak link. At 17, to try and escape his family, Gary ran away and married 15-year-old Valene and got her pregnant, which resulted in the birth of their daughter Lucy. Valene eventually forced Gary to introduce her to his family, and upon his return Jock and Miss Ellie gave him a home and a job on Southfork Ranch. J.R., who disliked Valene and resented Gary's presence, harassed Gary to the point of alcoholism and forced him off the ranch. Gary disappeared and wound up working as a waiter in a Las Vegas hotel, where he encountered Bobby and his wife Pam (Victoria Principal) in 1978.\n",
      "Bobby and Pam convinced Gary to return to Southfork, reconciling with Lucy, who engineered a meeting between him and Valene. For a brief while, the three cohabited at Southfork as a family under Jock and Miss Ellie's eyes, but Gary soon felt trapped by Jock's expectations and J.R.'s resentment. Realising that this would send him back to alcoholism, Gary abandoned his family and Southfork. Valene followed, and the two eventually reconciled again and married in season 3. As a gift to the newlyweds, Miss Ellie bought them a house in California, where Gary and Valene settled after their honeymoon.\n",
      "Gary remained in California, free from the pressures of his family, although he returned to Dallas on several occasions: to visit J.R. in hospital after Kristin Shepard (Mary Crosby) tried to kill him; for Lucy's wedding to Mitch Cooper (Leigh McCloskey); to support Miss Ellie after the death of his father, Jock; and for Bobby's \"funeral\" during the dream season. Following this, Gary didn't return to Dallas again, although he appeared in an alternate reality in which J.R. had never been born during the series finale: without J.R. to intimidate him, Gary became the eldest son and became a successful divorce lawyer, after inheriting Ewing Oil and running it into the ground. He still met and started a relationship with Valene, although they did not meet for the first time until their middle age (and, subsequently, did not have Lucy). The alternate reality also suggested that, regardless of J.R.'s interference, Gary and Valene were always destined to end up together.\n",
      "Gary and Valene's backstories and lives in California were the basis of Dallas spin-off series Knots Landing. The couple also appeared for brief story arcs in the revival series.\n",

They originally aired on CBS in the United States on September 20 and 27, 2005. Both episodes are written by Donald Bellisario, the show's creator and executive producer at the time.

      "The episode opens with a recap of the second season's finale, \"Twilight\": as the NCIS team by Leroy Jethro Gibbs (Mark Harmon) engage in a gunfight against Ari Haswari's terrorist cell, Ari (Rudolf Martin), identified as a rogue terrorist, attempts to kill various NCIS agents including Tim McGee (Sean Murray) before Ari decides to fatally shoot NCIS Agent Kate Todd (Sasha Alexander) with a long range sniper shot, killing her instantly with a horrified Gibbs and Tony DiNozzo (Michael Weatherly) witnessing Kate's death. In the aftermath of the murder, the team struggles to come to terms with her death while an enraged Gibbs seeks revenge against Ari. Shortly afterwards, Ari attacks again, firing at Abby in her lab. However, she survives physically unharmed.\n",
      "Then NCIS Director Tom Morrow (Alan Dale) announces that he is leaving the agency after receiving a job offer from Homeland Security and introduces Jenny Shepard (Lauren Holly) as his replacement. It immediately becomes apparent that Gibbs was romantically involved with Shepard while working undercover with her years earlier, though she insists that she is now nothing more than his boss and will act accordingly. Gibbs clashes with Shepard, who believes that Ari Haswari was not the one responsible for firing the bullet that killed Agent Todd due to the fact that there's no physical evidence or proof of any kind linking him to the crime.\n",
      "Ziva David (Cote de Pablo), Ari's Mossad control officer, arrives shortly afterwards, striking up a rapport with Tony. She sides with the director and further weakens Gibbs' case, claiming that Ari is completely innocent and offering evidence to support her assertion. However, Ziva's motives for defending Ari become ambiguous when she communicates with him without informing anyone in the NCIS office and her conversation indicates a personal connection to him.\n",
      "Gibbs realizes that Ziva has contacted Ari and orders Tony to tail her. Ari later returns, taking Gerald Jackson (Pancho Demmings) hostage, though he quickly notifies Ducky to divert the team's attention away from Ziva and force Ducky into a meet.\n",

Ducky, who is released unharmed shortly after his abduction, admits to Gibbs that he has begun to believe Ari's claims of innocence after listening to his defense, leaving Gibbs further enraged.\n",
      "After tailing Ari's control officer, Ziva David, for much of the evening, Tony reports to Gibbs that she is communicating with Ari and smuggling a passport and money to him through an unknown woman (Gloria Votsis), presumably another Mossad officer. However, Ziva later approaches Tony and informs him that she was aware that he was following her the entire time. She also tells him that her younger sister Tali, who was \"sixteen and the best of us\", was killed in a Hamas suicide bombing, and that she kn\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mReflection: I could not find the information on Alan Shepard Jr.'s mother's hometown in this search, I will now search for Alan Shepard's mother's hometown.\n",
